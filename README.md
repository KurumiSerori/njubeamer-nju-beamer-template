This template is used in my thesis defence.

Based on [YLiu1231/njumath_beamer](https://github.com/YLiu1231/njumath_beamer), thanks for the work.

Compared with the original one, this template removes some inappropriately placed background and headlines.
Also come with some new ideas.

The template is out-of-the-box.
The files are self-explained, and you should be able to customize it easily as you wish.

Hope you like it.

### What does this template look like

### About the fonts
The [fonts](./fonts/) are for CTeX setting, usually you don't need them, or you can download and install them.

The template is using Adobe fonts as CJKfont to avoid uncommon Chinese letter.
